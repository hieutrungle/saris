    """A bijector that computes the hyperbolic tangent.

    The log-determinant implementation in this bijector is more numerically stable
    than relying on the automatic differentiation approach used by Lambda, so this
    bijector should be preferred over Lambda(jnp.tanh) where possible. See
    `tfp.bijectors.Tanh` for details.

    When the absolute value of the input is large, `Tanh` becomes close to a
    constant, so that it is not possible to recover the input `x` from the output
    `y` within machine precision. In cases where it is needed to compute both the
    forward mapping and the backward mapping one after the other to recover the
    original input `x`, it is the user's responsibility to simplify the operation
    to avoid numerical issues; this is unlike the `tfp.bijectors.Tanh`. One
    example of such case is to use the bijector within a `Transformed`
    distribution and to obtain the log-probability of samples obtained from the
    distribution's `sample` method. For values of the samples for which it is not
    possible to apply the inverse bijector accurately, `log_prob` returns NaN.
    This can be avoided by using `sample_and_log_prob` instead of `sample`
    followed by `log_prob`.
