class Sigmoid(base.Bijector):
    """A bijector that computes the logistic sigmoid.

    The log-determinant implementation in this bijector is more numerically stable
    than relying on the automatic differentiation approach used by Lambda, so this
    bijector should be preferred over Lambda(jax.nn.sigmoid) where possible. See
    `tfp.bijectors.Sigmoid` for details.

    Note that the underlying implementation of `jax.nn.sigmoid` used by the
    `forward` function of this bijector does not support inputs of integer type.
    To invoke the forward function of this bijector on an argument of integer
    type, it should first be cast explicitly to a floating point type.

    When the absolute value of the input is large, `Sigmoid` becomes close to a
    constant, so that it is not possible to recover the input `x` from the output
    `y` within machine precision. In cases where it is needed to compute both the
    forward mapping and the backward mapping one after the other to recover the
    original input `x`, it is the user's responsibility to simplify the operation
    to avoid numerical issues; this is unlike the `tfp.bijectors.Sigmoid`. One
    example of such case is to use the bijector within a `Transformed`
    distribution and to obtain the log-probability of samples obtained from the
    distribution's `sample` method. For values of the samples for which it is not
    possible to apply the inverse bijector accurately, `log_prob` returns NaN.
    This can be avoided by using `sample_and_log_prob` instead of `sample`
    followed by `log_prob`.
